			"description": "Elevate Direct is a highly sophisticated AI and machine learning talent acquisition platform, specially designed to increase the productivity of your talent function and hiring communities across all workforce categories.  I worked on the data product side bringing R and D to production. I also worked on sales and marketing analysis to enhance our value proposition. My business development work brought in revenue and finally I taught classes internally on AI.  I work with technologies such as Python, Tensorflow and Spark - for building and maintaining our data products. I built some Convolutional Neural Network models and evaluated some of the infrastructure for deploying these models.  In conjunction to shipping data products - such as the market ranking functionality (with a small team) I also wrote some PR pieces, did blog posts, presented research on Variational Inference internally, did a webinar and spoke publicly about Elevate Direct."
